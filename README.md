# Python-Projects
Repository created for the purpose of receiving summitted coursework produced from the Python Course and storage for future reference.
Introduction:
	The coursework stored in this repository are the result of completed coursework for the Python Course.  Through the duration of this course, I have utilized the concepts and material
	 covered in this course to successfully complete various assignments, challenges, and projects.
Tech:
	-Language(s) & Modules Used: Python, Tkinter, Django
	-IDE: IDLE
	-Chrome Web Browser

Assignments & Projects:
	-Abstraction Assignment: Demonstrated the ability to use abstraction in order to run a method in a child class when parent class method is an abstracted one.
	-Database Assignment: Utilized python to create, access, edit, and delete databases and the stored data within it
	-Django Checkbook Project: Through guidance, this project allowed the creation of a fictional bank website that allows you to create a bank acocunt, perform transactions, and view balances
		of specified accounts.  This created a more complex web page than earlier projects.
	-DjangoUniversity Project: Followed the given instructions to create a simple web page that was able to store data relative to a class, the name of the class, the teacher, the class number,
		and the duration of the class.
	-Encapsulation Assignment: Exercised the concept of encapsulation by successfully running code that prevented or would suggest to any other developer from changing a method or variable
	-File Transfer Assignment: Utilized various modules (tkinter, shutil, time, os, tkinter.filedialog) to create a GUI with functional buttons that allowed for specifying folders to
		transfer specified files between.
	-Inheritance Assignment: The assignment provided an opportunity to practice adding child specific properties and behaviors along with inheriting the parent class's properties and behaviors
	-Nice or Mean Game: This game was created in order to create a simple game that based the outcome on your interactions with people you come accross in the game.  Based on win or lose conditions,
		a particular picture was opened to reflect if you won or lost.
	-Polymorphism Assignment: Used the concept of overriding a parent class method to fulfill the functional needs of a child class.
	-Web Page Creator GUI Assignment: Successfully created a GUI that generated a simple web page with a user specified header using python and tkinter.
